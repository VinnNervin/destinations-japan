                ancient castles,
                experiencing the excitement of a sumo match,

                <h3>1. tokyo</h3>
                <p>Tokyo is a city forever reaching into the future,
                    pushing the boundaries of what's possible on
                    densely populated,
                    earthquake-prone land,
                    adding ever taller,
                    sleeker structures. It's Japan's top spot for contemporary art and architecture,
                    pop culture,
                    shopping,
                    drinking and entertainment (and a tie with Kyoto for dining). But more than any other sight,
                    it's the city itself that enchants
                    visitors. It's a sprawling, organic thing, stretching as far as the eye can see.</p>

                <h3>2. kyoto</h3>
                <p>Kyoto,
                    Japan's imperial capital for a thousand years, is home to more than a thousand temples.
                    Among
                    them are the monumental,
                    like Kinkaku-ji (an exquisite pavilion sheathed entirely in gold leaf),
                    and the meditative,
                    like Ryōan-ji,
                    with its stark Zen rock garden. And temples are only the start of it: there's the culture of
                    tea, which you can appreciate at one of the city's many elegant teahouses;
                    the art of the geisha,
                    those iconic performers of traditional music and dance;
                    and also a rich food culture,
                    including kaiseki (Japanese haute cuisine).</p>

                <p>Even from a distance,
                    Mt Fuji will take your breath away. Close up,
                    the perfectly symmetrical cone of Japan's highest peak is nothing short of incredible. Dawn
                    from the summit? Pure magic. Fuji-san
                    is among Japan's most revered and timeless attractions. Hundreds of thousands of people
                    climb it
                    every year,
                    continuing a centuries-old tradition of pilgrimages up the sacred volcano. Those who'd
                    rather search for picture-perfect views from the less-daunting peaks nearby can follow in
                    the steps of Japan's most famous painters and poets.</p>

                <h3>4. hiroshima</h3>
                <p>Hiroshima today is a forward-thinking city with attractive,
                    leafy boulevards. It's not until you
                    visit the Peace Memorial Museum that the true extent of human tragedy wreaked by the atomic
                    bomb becomes vividly clear. A visit here is a heartbreaking,
                    important history lesson. The park around the museum,
                    much of which was designed by Japan's great modernist architect Tange Kenzō, offers many
                    opportunities for reflection. But the city's spirit of determination – as well as its food –
                    will
                    ensure that you'll have good memories to take with you when you leave.</p>

                <h3>5. osaka</h3>
                <p>Tokyo doesn't nab all the superlatives when it comes to urban experiences. Osaka, Japan's
                    third-largest city,
                    is tops for street food: don't miss its signature dish, takoyaki (grilled
                    octopus dumplings). It also has the most dramatic of nightscapes: a dazzling display of LED
                    lights,
                    animated signage and flashing video screens along the canalside strip Dōtombori. The city,
                    Japan's
                    oldest merchant center,
                    has a pace,
                    spirit and zest for life all of its own;
                    its unofficial slogan is kuidaore (eat until you drop).</p>
